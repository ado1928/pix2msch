# pix2msch
A program that converts images into Mindustry schematics

The usage should be pretty self explainatory once you open gui.py

If you're on Windows, you can go to releases, download and run pix2msch.exe. No Python installation needed.

Note: You will need `pyperclip` and `pillow` to run gui.py. You can install them by doing `pip install <package>`

WARNING: Images above 100x100 don't actually seem large, but when converted to a Mindustry schematic, it's actually huge, so I recommend to keep images below 100x100
